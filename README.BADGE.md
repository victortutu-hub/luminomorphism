**Luminomorphism** is a next-generation UI design system that elevates interface elements into living, light-reactive components.  
It blends principles of fluid design, sensory feedback, and futuristic motion to transform digital surfaces into luminous experiences.

> ✨ It's not a visual style — it's a reactive presence.
